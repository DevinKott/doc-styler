# DocStyler

## Design Doc

### Project Overview

DocStyler is a simple user interface that allows a user to enter documentation
and receive that documentation formatted a specific way.

### Objectives

My objectives for this project are as follows:

1. Build a tool I've been wanting at work
2. Learn a new web framework (Astro)
3. Improve design documentation skills
4. Complete this as a weekend project

### Target Audience

The target audience, first and foremost, is me.
I will design the tool to support the features I want.
However, the more general audience consists of developers that want a very
simple way to stylize documentation in their code.

### Features

1. 80 Character limit
2. Header option
3. Sub-header option
4. Border options (enabled, character, etc.)
5. Comment Style (`//` vs `#`)
